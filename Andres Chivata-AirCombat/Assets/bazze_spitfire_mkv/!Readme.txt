The poser model has parts that you can pose using these control dials (limits are applied). You can of course also move/position these parts manually in other applications too.

Poser control dials:
- Cockpit [Opens/Closes the cockpit]
- Rudder [Turns the rudder left and right]
- Pitch [Controls the angle of the elevator]
- Rear Wheel [Turns the wheel in the rear to the left and right]
- Turn Pilots Head [Makes the pilot look left or right]
- Aileron [Simultaneously controls the movement of both ailerons]
- Flaps [Simultaneously controls the movement of both flaps]
- Spin Propeller [Spins the blurred and the not blurred propellers, depending which one is shown]
- Undercarriage [Simultaneously opens/closed the undercarriage under both wings]
- Spin Wheels [Simultaneously spins the undercarriage wheels]

All control dials are grouped to the "Body".
